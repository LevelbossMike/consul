# AWS Lambda

Consul supports registering [AWS Lambdas](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and
invoking them from mesh services.

## Registering Lambdas

The first step toward integrating Lambdas into Consul is registering them as
services into Consul. The [overview
page](/docs/lambda/registration/overview) describes the process of
registering Lambdas at a high level along with explaining how to register
Lambdas with [Lambda registrator](/docs/lambda/registration/lambda-registrator)
and [manually](/docs/lambda/registration/manual).

## Invoking Lambdas

Lambdas can be invoked by any mesh service directly from connect proxies or
through a terminating gateways. The [invocation page](/docs/lambda/invocation)
explains how to invoke Lambdas from Consul connect services.
