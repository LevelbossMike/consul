# features

A service that encapsulates the handling of
[feature-flags](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/feature-flags).
Internally this service uses the `features`-section in `config/environment` to
determine if a feature is on or off.

## Usage in javascript

```js
export default class MyComponent extends Component {
  @service features;

  get shouldShow() {
    return this.features.isEnabled('awesome-feature');
  }
}
```

## Checking if a feature is on in the template layer

To check if a particular `feature` is on or off in the template layer you can
use the `feature-flag`-helper that uses the `features`-service internally:

```hbs

{{#if (feature-flag 'awesome-feature')}}
  <div>The awesome feature is on</div>
{{/if}}
```
